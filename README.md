# Multi-drone-delivery-system

#### Goal
Implement a decentrialized controller for a multi-drone delivery system. Waypoints for the package are predefined and the goal is to follow them as closely as possible. The environment is composed of static buildings, dynamic objects and unknown wind forces.


#### Implementation

The implementation is done in **C#** through **Unity**.
All files modified are contained in [Assets](https://github.com/robin-maillot/drone_package_delivery/tree/master/Assets).

test_problem.json can be used as a reference for how maps are defined.
